# Debate-Motion-Classifier

This is my first project under language processing and is mostly an experimental project that I'll be using to understand language processing better.  
  
The aim of the project is to create a program which can classify and arrange a given list of debate motions into different categories based on motion type (THBT or This house believes that, THR or This house regrets, etc.) and also based on topic (International Relations, Economics, Justice, etc.)  

To accomplish the first task of classification based on motion type, I intend to use a rule-based classification. The classification method for the second task is still undecided.
